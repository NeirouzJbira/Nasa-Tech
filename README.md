# React Technical Test - NASA API image search app

As set out in the technical test brief, this React web application allows users to search for images in the NASA image database, based on a query relating to space. It uses the API endpoint provided as part of the brief.

The user is able to enter a keyword relating to space, such as 'Supernova' or 'Saturn' to search for relevant images. Upon clicking the search icon or hitting enter, the search results are displayed in a masonry-style grid. If an invalid keyword is entered and no results are returned, an error message is displayed: "Sorry, no results. Please try again".

The app is responsive and has been styled appropriately for both mobile and desktop versions.

During the development process, the app was fully tested using Jest and React Testing Library to write unit tests, following Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology.
